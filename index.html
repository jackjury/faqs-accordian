        <strong><span>+</span> How long will it take?</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        The time taken to capture your venue depends on the number of
        photographs captured. Each photograph takes approximately 1 minute to
        complete, and we aim to capture a photo every 2-3m.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most venues up to around 2,500m2 will be able to be captured within a
        day.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong><span>+</span> How much does it cost? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>Our price includes:</p>
      <p>Virtual 3D Model of your Venue Hire of the camera and operator.</p>
      <p>1 year hosting on the Matterport platform.</p>
      <p>Support in integrating the models into the venue website.</p>
      <p>
        The price is bespoke based upon the size and complexity of the venue,
        please contact us for a quotation. If you can provide us with any
        existing floor plans you have that will help us get a good feel for your
        venue.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong><span>+</span> What happens on the day? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        A member of our team will introduce themselves on arrival, and we find
        it is best to walk through all the areas you want to include within the
        capture together at the beginning of the day. This is a great
        opportunity to understand what else you have going on in the building
        that day, so we can best plan our capture route, it is also a great
        chance to make sure all of your rooms are looking at their best!
      </p>
      <p>
        Once this has been completed, our team members will get the equipment up
        and running and start capturing the spaces. The time each room takes to
        capture depends on the size and complexity of the space, but each room
        will take between 15min and an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team members will then work their way along the pre-agreed capture
        route, ensuring that corridors and common areas between each room is
        captured too.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we capture more data, we produce a simplified floor plan of the
        building. We can use this to ensure that we have got everything you
        need.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, our team member will upload all of the raw images
        to the Matterport cloud platform for processing. Depending on the
        complexity of the venue this can take from a few hours to a few days to
        complete.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong><span>+</span> What about COVID-19? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        All 3D capture bookings will adhere to any COVID-19 guidelines that are
        applicable at the time. The capture process allows for social distancing
        to be accommodated and minimal interaction with any venue surfaces. A
        full risk assessment will be provided before the booking that can be
        discussed and agreed with the relevant stakeholders at the venue.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong
          ><span>+</span> How Long will it be before we can use the venue model?
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        We will always ensure that the raw data is uploaded to the platform on
        the same day as the capture where possible. It then takes some time for
        the Matterport platform to process the data and return the model. We
        then need to ensure that any tweaks that we need to make are done, and
        we will then send you the model for approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to have the model with you within 5 working days. If you need it
        sooner then please let us know before the capture date and we will see
        what we can do to meet your needs.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong><span>+</span> How do we need to prepare the spaces? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Very much in the same way you would for any other types of photography.
        This is your opportunity to show your venue off at its best. Ideally
        meeting and conferencing spaces should be set up ready for an event,
        make use of screens and displays to show your logo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The space to be captured needs to be free of people, so empty rooms are
        best.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to ensure that we can tie everything together, each photograph
        must be taken sequentially, ie we can’t do one room then another without
        capturing the route in-between. Our team can advise on the best order to
        capture the rooms in, working around other things you might have going
        on on the day.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong><span>+</span> Can we show different room layouts? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Absolutely! We can include a virtual Mattertag in any room, from which
        the person viewing the model can just click a button and jump straight
        into the room with another setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clearly we have to photograph both room setups for this to work, so have
        a chat to our team and we will work out the best way for us to do this
        with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can add on these alternative room layouts at a later date if you
        need, so there is no rush to get this done straight away.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong><span>+</span> How can we view the model? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        The model is hosted on the Matterport platform, allowing you and your
        clients to view it right from your browser, either on your computer or
        mobile device.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can provide you with a link to imbed it onto your website, or a
        direct link to the model that you can email straight to your clients.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong><span>+</span> Can we put it on our website? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Yes! We can provide you with the code that can be really simply embedded
        on your website, just in the same way a twitter or facebook app might
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can work with the technical staff that manage your website in order
        to ensure this process goes smoothly, even providing dummy content for
        testing prior to agreeing to a contract if you are concerned about how
        the integration will work.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong
          ><span>+</span> Are there any limitations on the areas you can
          capture?
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        The models work best for venues that are mainly indoor environments. We
        can capture outdoor areas as well if required, depending on the space we
        may be able to include these within the main tour, or we might need to
        add these on as standalone 360degree photographs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Large empty spaces, such as empty ballrooms etc, are difficult to
        capture properly but tend to work fine with some furniture, such as
        tables or chairs in. If you do have any large empty spaces that you need
        us to capture let us know and we will see what we can do.
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong
          ><span>+</span> Can we add our model to Google Streetview?
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Yes! This is a great way to make your model more visible to a wider
        audience. There is a small additional fee for this service, and Google’s
        t&amp;c’s exclude a very limited number of models, so please get in
        touch with us to find out more!
      </p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong
          ><span>+</span> Can we view our model in Virtual Reality (VR)?
        </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Of course! If you open the model on your mobile phone, you can touch the
        Google Cardboard logo (bottom right corner) to launch the VR mode.
      </p>
      <p>You will need a google cardboard viewer to place your phone into.</p>
      <p>
        This works even better with the Matterport VR app, just follow the links
        to install it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can, of course, supply you with some branded Google Cardboard
        headsets for you to send out to your clients allowing them to virtually
        work right through your venue!
      </p>
      <p>Speak to our team for a cost for this.</p>
      <h4 class="question">
        <strong><span>+</span> How do I update my model? </strong>
      </h4>
      <p>Up to 28days after the capture date.</p>
      <p>
        We will still have the raw data on file, so we may be able to make the
        changes you need. Please contact us and we will see what we can do.
        There maybe an additional fee if we need to attend the site again.
      </p>
      <p>Later than 28days after the capture date.</p>
      <p>
        In line with our data retention policy, we no longer have the raw data
        required to simply amend the existing model. We have a couple of options
        here, we can either recapture the entire venue, or we maybe able to just
        capture the changed areas, and link it into the main model.
      </p>
      <p>Contact us and we will see what we can do.</p>
